ðŸš€ Hey I'm a Full Stack MERN Engineer with expertise in Front End.
## My portfolio : [https://new-portfolio-theta-jade.vercel.app]
## I did API Testing in my previous AI - Powered MERN Project : [https://github.com/TusharBhatt1/genius-mern]

## Project Test Summary
This project includes extensive testing with a total of 6 test suites covering 20 test cases. The results are as follows:

### Passed: 18 tests
### Failed: 2 tests

### Test Suites
2 Integration Testings + 3 Unit Testings


## Conclusion
The majority of test cases have passed, demonstrating the reliability of the application. Would like to have a discussion over the failed ones before the passed one.
Thankyou.
